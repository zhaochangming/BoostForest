Welcome to BoostForest's documentation!
=======================================
**BoostForest** [1] is an ensemble learning approach that bases on model tree [2], boosting [3] and bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) [4]. It is designed to be efficient with the following advantages:


- Support of classification and regression in supervised learning.
- Support of achieving better generalization performance than traditional tree-based ensemble learning approaches.
